Queries that do not reference a specific movie or TV show by name or media ID and instead seek general information, recommendations, or comparisons about movies or TV shows based on themes, genres, settings, ratings, budgets, or other attributes. These queries are exploratory and often involve lists, categories, or broad inquiries about media without pinpointing a single title.

  **Examples:**
  - "Movies that take place in the sea or the ocean."
  - "What are some highly rated sci-fi movies from the 2000s?"
  - "Which movies had the highest budgets in 2020?"
  - "TV shows about time travel."

  **Routing Logic:** Route to `media-browsing` when the query does not mention a specific title or media ID and focuses on discovering or comparing media based on general criteria or attributes.
