Queries that mention a specific cast or crew member by their name or ID and ask for detailed information about that person (e.g., biography, filmography, awards, birth date, etc.).

  **Examples:**
    - "Who is Sigourney Weaver?"
    - "What are some movies Sigourney Weaver has been in?"
    - "Tell me about Keanu Reeves."
    - "What awards has Saoirse Ronan won?"

  **Routing Logic:** Route to `person-detail` when the query explicitly references a person (by name or ID) and seeks specific or general information about that person, such as their biography, filmography, or achievements.
