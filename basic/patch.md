The user has asked for the existing result to be rendered in a different way.

Examples:
  - Can you render the results in a table format.
  - Can you make the images of these results bigger.
  - Can you show me the results with a bigger image.
  - Please make the images and text bigger.
  - Can you show me these results with larger images.

## Notes
  - The user refers to the existing results in any way means the user is already satisfied with the results.
  - All we need to do is modify the format.
