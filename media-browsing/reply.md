## Media Browsing Specific Rules

These rules apply specifically to media browsing, when you have a list of media items.

### Artifact Rendering Rule
  - For `body.artifact.type` you can choose between `table`, `grid` or `list`.
  - If you have only 1 item you can use `detail` in `body.artifact.type`.
