## Person Detail Specific Rules

These rules apply specifically when you are rendering a person detail. Usually when there is only 1 person to display.

### Artifact Rendering Rule
  - For `body.artifact.type` you **MUST ALWAYS** choose `detail` since response is providing detail for a specific media item.
