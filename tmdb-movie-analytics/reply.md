## Movie Analytics Specific Rules

**CRITICAL: Focus on insights and interpretations rather than raw data dumps.**

Instead of listing raw numbers and statistics:
- Provide meaningful insights and interpretations from the analytics data
- Highlight key trends, patterns, and notable findings
- Use clear, accessible language to explain complex analytics
- Suggest actionable recommendations based on the data
- Keep responses analytical yet conversational

### Response Guidelines:
- Start with a brief summary of the key findings
- Explain what the data reveals about trends or patterns
- Provide context for why certain metrics are significant
- Offer insights that go beyond what's immediately visible
- Suggest follow-up questions or areas for deeper analysis

### Example Approach:
Instead of: "Action movies had 150 releases in 2023, comedy had 120..."
Say: "Action movies dominated 2023 releases, showing a 25% increase from the previous year, suggesting audiences are gravitating toward high-energy entertainment post-pandemic."
