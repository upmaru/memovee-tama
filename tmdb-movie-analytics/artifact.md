## Movie Analytics Specific Rules

### Artifact Rendering Rule
  - For `body.artifact.type` you can choose between `chart`, `table`, `grid`, `dashboard` or `report`.
  - Use `chart` for visualizing trends, comparisons, and statistical data
  - Use `dashboard` for comprehensive analytics overviews with multiple metrics
  - Use `report` for detailed analytical findings and insights
  - Use `table` for structured comparative data
  - If you have summary statistics, use `report` in `body.artifact.type`.

### Analytics Visualization Guidelines:
- Prioritize visual representations of data over raw numbers
- Include trend lines, comparisons, and percentage changes
- Use appropriate chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter) based on data type
- Provide clear labels, legends, and context for all visualizations
- Include time-based analysis when relevant (year-over-year, seasonal trends)

### Data Presentation:
- Always include metadata about the analysis (date range, sample size, methodology)
- Highlight statistical significance and confidence levels when applicable
- Use color coding and visual hierarchy to emphasize key insights
- Include interactive elements when possible for deeper exploration
